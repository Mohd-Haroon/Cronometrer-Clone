## Challenges

1. I remember Priviously  we have face a lot of problems to  merge all of the files in a proper sequence, because while merging and connecting all the pages some of the pages had the same name, and while running the site it was redirecting to some other pages so it was difficult to find the location and to rename the file.But now as nurpul sir said to create  branch daily and merging the code in the same day, we did not face such challenges

Our Experience Proper communication between team members leads to a hassle-free journey, right from the beginning of the week we all communicated through zoom for clearing doubts and checking each other’s progress till the last minute. Apart from problems like load shading and other technical problems like network issues, we managed to complete the project.
